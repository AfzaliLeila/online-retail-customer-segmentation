# Customer Strategic Segmentation – Online Retail

## Business problem

Which customer segments create the most value for the business today, and how should we re‑engage high‑value customers who are at risk of churn?

A mid‑size UK‑based online retailer has several years of invoice‑level e‑commerce data but no unified view of customer value or loyalty. Marketing leaders suspect that a small subset of customers drives a disproportionate share of revenue and that some of these high‑value customers have quietly stopped purchasing. This project builds a customer segmentation framework to prioritize retention and win‑back campaigns.

## Tools and stack

- SQL – data cleaning and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) aggregation into a customer‑level table.
- R – feature engineering and k‑means clustering to define customer segments and approximate customer lifetime value. 
- Tableau / Power BI – executive dashboard for monitoring segment performance and identifying high‑value at‑risk customers.
## Data

- UCI Online Retail (or Online Retail II) dataset: historical invoice‑level transactions for a UK‑based online retailer, including invoice number, product, quantity, timestamp, unit price, customer ID, and country.
- Dataset is used as a raw source only; all data cleaning, modeling, and visualization are my own.
